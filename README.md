# MinecraftSeverSideXray
A sever plugin that allows players to have x-ray for a given radius.  
Use "/xrayradius <radius>" to start it and "/xrayradius reset" to restore the blocks to being visible.  
After giving a radius, mine a block. Everyblock, except ores, within that radius to bedrock will become invisible.
